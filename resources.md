## Useful code examples:
Official [AntShares Github organization](https://github.com/AntShares)

AntShares [SDKs](https://github.com/AntSharesSDK) for Python, Typescript, and Ruby

COZ is re-writing the AntShares SDK. It's still very messy and a work in progress, but [the source](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-wallet-js/blob/master/src/wallet.js) and [tests](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-wallet-js/blob/master/tests/index.js) are probably the best current SDK resource at the moment. 

A [slightly cleaner JS SDK wrapper](https://github.com/neochainio/neowallet/blob/master/js/wallet.js) in Neowallet (third party wallet implementation)

Source code for the [official web wallet](https://github.com/AntShares/AntSharesApp/tree/master/AntSharesApp/www)

Good example of how to [send ANS in Python](https://github.com/AntSharesSDK/antshares-python/blob/master/sdk/AntShares/Wallets/Wallet.py) using `sendrawtransaction`

To understand how this code works, [the network protocol docs](http://docs.antshares.org/en-us/node/network-protocol.html)
