1.	Contributors will fork from a City of Zion (COZ) repository feature branch to their own user branch.
2.	Contributors will work on and refine their own version of the branch.
3.	Contributors will initiate a pull request (PR) for their changes to the COZ feature branch, upon which COZ members and the community will review the work done (including testing if necessary). 
4.	If approved by COZ, it will be merged into the COZ feature branch.
5.	The COZ feature branch will initiate a PR to the AntShares (ANS) master repository. 
6.	If approved by the ANS Core team, the changes will be merged into ANS master.
7.	Upon merge into ANS master, the COZ master repository will sync with ANS master and inherit all changes accepted, leaving no difference between the two.
8.	Repeat from step 1.

NOTE: All branching from COZ for feature requests will be handled by COZ. Contributors need not concern themselves with this issue.

NOTE 2: After rebranding to NEO on July 24, this workflow will change. This will be updated on that date.
